# CPP_LAB

Solutions for the tasks I was given during the C++ course in the 4th semester.
The goal of this course was to understand advanced concepts of C++, with particular emphasis on polymorphism, class and function templates, and the correct use of smart pointers for memory management. The course also deepened the knowledge of the rule of 0/3/5, operator overloading, and best practices related to writing clean, reusable code that adheres to principles such as DRY.
